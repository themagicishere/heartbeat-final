        Music makes our lives, and the events in our lives, special and memorable. While few find fame and fortune, most musicians remain in the field for their love and passion of music. The choice an individual makes to be a professional musician is one of sacrifice. The average income across the various employment options, while accounting for the part-time nature of most opportunities, is less than $25,000 annually. Over 65% of professional musicians do not have health insurance. Since the mid 1960s (Post Beatles) the number of individuals choosing music as a career has grown exponentially. Previous to this time, most professionals were either orchestra and classical players or jazz and blues artists. The explosion of pop, rock and country career musicians over a 20-year period in the U.S. has represented an artistic and cultural revolution.
The financial hardship a working musician faces when dealing with illness or disability is a constant, but we now also face a burgeoning elder population of artists with little or no resources available for such emergency situations.
