        Our Mission
      </h2>
  
      <p class="our-mission">
Heartbeat is a non-profit organization that seeks to help communities grow stronger with assistance from the organization to get access to instruments for those who need it as well as music lessons from local musicians for children and teens. In addition, online classes and events will be hold to spread our reach beyond the communities in direct reach and to create a more accessible community for all. For Heartbeat’s identity system, I would like for the abstract shapes that make up the guitar image to be consistently a part of all of the organization's deliverables. The shapes do not necessarily have to interact with each other, as long as they are many of them within a confined space to represent the community we are helping build. The shapes themselves will either be filled or have thick strokes (if left unfilled), we would like to represent the strength of music through these decisions and be visually bold to capture the attention of onlookers. These shapes must remain the same but can change colors however, the abstract heart/guitar seen next to the logo type must always remain pastel red and pastel blue. Lastly, any imagery used will be overlaid with a monochrome and blow up in proportion to show pieces of the imagery rather than all of it. By doing this, the identity of colors and shapes is in the spotlight and will be recognizable as Heartbeat’s identity system with time.
